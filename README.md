Responsive Web Design: Survey Form

The second of five projects needed for freeCodeCamp.org's Responsive Web Design certificate.

The project had to satisfy a few criterions, mostly involving styling and responsive web design, in order for it to pass tests. I would have structured the page differently if this had been a personal or professional project. May come around to making it look nicer in the future, but for now I'm moving on to the next project.
